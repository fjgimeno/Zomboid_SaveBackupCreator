# Zomboid_SaveBackupCreator
A simple python tool to create backups from your saves

~~This app only supports the main play modes, no challenge modes at all are supported.~~

Added the posibility to backup saves from the three challenge maps that exist as of March 24 2025

Usage:
  Windows:
    Open the executable and follow the on-screen instructions

  Linux/MAC/Windows_CMD:
    open CreateBackup.py using the terminal with the following command: "python CreateBackup.py" (Terminal should be in the same directory as the CreateBackup.py, alternatively, use absolute path to the file).
    On linux, one may be able to double click the *.py file directly, but this has not been tested.
